# Interview Scheduler

  Interview Scheduler is a React applcaition that was created during the REACT portion of the LIghthouse Labs bootcamp. The application is a friendly week calender where the user can modify interview appointments during the week. Some main functionality of the app are as follows

    - Allows to view appointments scheduled during the week with which student & interviewer
    - Allows to create, delete, & edit interview appointments 
    - Has edge cases and shows errors when bookes/deletion/edits are not performed correctly 

  During the project I used the following tools

    - React
    - Axios
    - Babel
    - PostgreSQL

  Testing was performed using

    - StoryBook
    - Jest 
    - Cypress
